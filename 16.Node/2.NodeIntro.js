/**
 => Node: 
 -> node is not a language. It is not even a framework.

 Q> what is node?
 -> node is a runtime environment(just like browser) for js.
 -> Initially js was made to run on browser only. And a lot of features of js comes from browser only.
    Ex: By default js are single threaded. but browser allow js to run asynchrounously.
 -> What browser render: html. so, browser gives more features to js like dom etc. to manipulate html.
 
 -> Since, js was running only in browser, so it was having very limited use.
 -> So, a new runtime environment node is introduced to run js outside the browser. since, it is running outside the browser, so 
    it doesn't mean to manipulate html.
 -> Node allow js to run directly on terminal, it means js will directly able to interact with our operating system.
 -> So, operating system features will be accessible to js when we run js using node environment.
    like, it will give access to your file system stored in hard-drive. It means we can change the file, read the file, create the file etc.
 -> you get access to process system.
 -> It opens streams features. Ex: standard input, standard output.
 -> now you will be able to do all those things, which your other language was doing.
 -> we can create desktop app now.
 -> node js is open source.

 -> coding js somewhere is just a file. now where we run this file is the main thing. we can run on browser or we can run on node.
 -> Deno is another runtime environment for js.
